# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

**Pretty confident. Very similar to some methods I know of in C#. Still bit hesitant seeing some of the other methods in the documentation, though.**

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

**Absolutely confident. Can't wait to do more!**

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

**Since there is no specified data type for methods in Ruby, can methods just break if you accidentally put in the wrong kind of data type intended for a method as an argument?**
